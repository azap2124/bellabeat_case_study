## Introduction
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. For this study, I was asked to help their marketing team get insights in order to make informed decisions for the future of their products and marketing strategy. Bellabeat was founded in 2013 and has grown very rapidly. It was quickly positioned as a tech-driven wellness company for women. They have five major products: Bellabeat App, Leaf Wellness Tracker, Time Watch, Spring Water Bottle, and their Bellabeat Membership. 
### About The Company
Bellabeat was founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur. Their products collect data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health allowing women to gain knowledge about their own health and habits.  

By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. Sršen and Mur know that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. 

### Scenario
Urška Sršen and Sando Murhave have asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, they would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy. I’ll offer my findings and recommendations to Bellabeat’s executive team.

## 1. Ask
### Identifying the business task:

I will analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. After this is accomplished, I'll select one Bellabeat product and apply these insights to my presentation.

### Questions to consider:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

**Primary stakeholders:** Urška Sršen and Sando Mur - Executive team members

**Secondary stakeholders:** Bellabeat's marketing analytics team


## 2. Prepare
For this next step, I will use Google's ROCCC methodology in order to figure out if there are any problems with the data and if it has any problems with bias or credibility. I used this [database](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) for my analysis. 

#### Data Source
This dataset includes thirty participants. Thirty Fitbit users willingly provided their consent for the collection of personal tracker data, which included minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The dataset has 18 CSV documents each containing different data insights. 

#### ROCCC Approach
* Reliability: **LOW**. A sample size of at least 30 is often considered the minimum acceptable size for statistical analysis. However, considering there's over 31 million active users for Fitbit, this dataset is not really realiable. Also, all of this data was collected in just one month, which is not long enough to find accurate and reliable trends. It's good, however, that the 30 minimum sample size rule is met.
* Originality: **LOW**. The data set was not original and was created through an Amazon Mechanical Turk survey, which is not an ideal approach as it would have been preferable for Fitbit to provide the information directly.
* Comprehensive: **MEDIUM**. In my opinion, this data is missing very important elements to make the analysis more complete. Some information that would be helpful to know is age, height, weight, or sex. We also don't the rules as to how this sample was selected. There is no way to know if the people who were chosen were chosen because of bias or if they were chosen at random. 
* Current: **MEDIUM**. The data collected is outdated, as it was gathered seven years ago, and may not provide an accurate representation of the current situation. However, people's live styles don't change drastically in a period of seven years. 
* Cited: **HIGH**. Data collector and source is well documented.
