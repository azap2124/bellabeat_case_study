## Introduction
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. For this study, I was asked to help their marketing team get insights in order to make informed decisions for the future of their products and marketing strategy. Bellabeat was founded in 2013 and has grown very rapidly. It was quickly positioned as a tech-driven wellness company for women. They have five major products: Bellabeat App, Leaf Wellness Tracker, Time Watch, Spring Water Bottle, and their Bellabeat Membership. 
### About The Company
Bellabeat was founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur. Their products collect data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health allowing women to gain knowledge about their own health and habits.  

By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. Sršen and Mur know that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. 

### Scenario
Urška Sršen and Sando Murhave have asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, they would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy. I’ll offer my findings and recommendations to Bellabeat’s executive team.  

Urška Sršen: Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat
