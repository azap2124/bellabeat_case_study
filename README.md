## Introduction
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. For this study, I was asked to help their marketing team get insights in order to make informed decisions for the future of their products and marketing strategy. Bellabeat was founded in 2013 and has grown rapidly. It was quickly positioned as a tech-driven wellness company for women. They have five major products: Bellabeat App, Leaf Wellness Tracker, Time Watch, Spring Water Bottle, and their Bellabeat Membership.
